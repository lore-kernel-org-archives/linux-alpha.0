I can't tell you exactly *when* it used to work, or even *if* it did
with 2.6 kernels.  I'll try to explain...

Sometime back in the 2.6.14 to 2.6.16 timeframe there was an issue with
the ALSA driver not recognizing interrupts (causing looping).  Tyson
Whitehead had put together a patch for the interrupt problem that worked
for him, but not for me or Michael.  One workaround back then was using
the snd-sb8 driver that supports only one DMA channel (half-duplex
operation) anyway: that was a reliable workaround, and may be what I'm
remembering for the "it used to work" case.  I can't find any reliable
evidence that I've *ever* been able to use the ES1888 with its proper
driver under ALSA with 2.6 kernels.  As far as Tyson's patch, I know
he reported it upstream to the ALSA developers, but I saw no followup
communication from either Tyson or the developers.

I'll give it a shot.

I'm beginning to think this is *not* a regression, but merely a long-
standing ALSA issue that was never addressed.  I would be fine with
reclassifying this as an ALSA bug and dropping linux-kernel from the
discussion.

As far as how to proceed from here, I'm certain things were broken in
2.6.1[4-6].  I could try various later releases between .16 and .24 to
see if snd-es18xx worked for any of those, but I think the answer will
be "no."  I think a useful test would be to see if "snd-sb8" works in
2.6.25-rcX, which would at least narrow things down a bit.
