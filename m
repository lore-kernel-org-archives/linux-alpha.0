Lovely, so different problem between you and Bob. When you (either of you) 
have some time for it again, could you try:

$ sox asskickd.wav -w -t alsa hw
$ sox asskickd.wav -w -r 44100 -t alsa hw
$ sox asskickd.wav -w -r 44100 -c 2 -t alsa hw

and report if things start working? First transforms into 16-bit, second 
16-bit and 44100 rate, third 16-bit, 44100 rate, stereo.

Not a clue. Takashi -- is it possible that Bob wasn't using mmap to being 
with if he didn't do anything specific to not do so?

And perhaps you guys have firmware settable options that touch that area of 
coherent DMA? Maybe even a specific chipset bug on his machine? No idea how 
different/similar your machines are...

No rush. Thanks for the current amount of testing already.
