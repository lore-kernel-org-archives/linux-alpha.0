As distributed, no change: still not seeing any activity on IRQ 5.  I'll
play around with it some over the next day or so.

Observed: the alsa "snd-sb8" driver works fine.  Question: how does IRQ
setup differ between the sb8 and the es18xx drivers?  If I can find some
time, I'll try to figure that out...
