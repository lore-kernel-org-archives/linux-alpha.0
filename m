A quick followup...  Since we're in agreement this isn't a regression,
I've updated my working source tree to 2.6.25-rc5.  Built the new
kernel with the patch to omit es1888_init(), and as near as I can tell,
that function does nothing useful on the Miata platform.  At the very
least, not having it makes no difference to any of the ALSA drivers I've
tried: snd-sb8 still works great, and snd-es18xx is still broken in the
same way originally described at the beginning of this long thread.

I'll try a build with the old OSS "sb" driver, and if that works ok, we
may be able to do away with es1888_init() on the Miata.  Tyson -- I
think you have a Miata if I'm remembering correctly: can you confirm
these observations?
