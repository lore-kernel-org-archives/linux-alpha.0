The hardware design for PCI on s390 is very different from any other
architecture, and more abstract. Rather than implementing MMIO register
access as pointer dereference, this is a separate CPU instruction that
takes a device/bar plus offset as arguments rather than a pointer, and
Linux encodes this back into a fake __iomem token.

There are separate instructions for PCI memory and config space, but
no instructions for I/O space, or for non-PCI MMIO that it could be mapped
into.
