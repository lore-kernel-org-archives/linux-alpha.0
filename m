Here is the requested list of CONFIG_ALPHA_* items for the
2.6.25-rc4+iommu_patch kernel with support for snd-es18xx and snd-sb8:

CONFIG_ALPHA=y
CONFIG_ALPHA_MIATA=y
CONFIG_ALPHA_EV5=y
CONFIG_ALPHA_CIA=y
CONFIG_ALPHA_EV56=y
CONFIG_ALPHA_PYXIS=y
CONFIG_ALPHA_SRM=y
CONFIG_ALPHA_LEGACY_START_ADDRESS=y

From arch/alpha/kernel/Makefile, obj-${CONFIG_ALPHA_MIATA} adds es1888.o
as a built-in object, so yes, it's built-in.

I never noticed the init support for the ES1888 chip before...  The code
appears to set up DMA channel 1, but does not mention anything about the
second 16-bit DMA channel.
