Well, I built a 2.6.22 kernel last night, and in tests this morning
there's no difference relative to the ALSA behavior seen in 2.6.25-rc4.
Since the question came up (or was strongly implied), I took the time to
check the status of IRQ 5 in /proc/interrupts, and while it shows up as
assigned to the sound card, no interrupts are being seen/processed by
the es18xx driver.  When I remove the snd-es18xx module and install the
snd-sb8 module with the same parameters (other than there's no second
DMA channel), the /proc/interrupts counter for IRQ 5 increments as
expected when playing sound files.

At this point I'm pretty sure the es18xx issue isn't a regression: it's
"just" a bug that has been around since I first loaded 2.6.X on my
Alpha.
