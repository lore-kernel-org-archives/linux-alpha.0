Thanks for the review Petr. Patch was already merged - my goal was to be
concise, i.e., a patch per driver / module, so the patch kinda fixes
whatever I think is wrong with the driver with regards panic handling.

Do you think it worth to remove this patch from Greg's branch just to
split it in 2? Personally I think it's not worth, but opinions are welcome.

About the RCU part, this one really could be a new patch, a good
improvement patch - it makes sense to me, we can think about that after
the fixes I guess.

Cheers,


Guilherme
