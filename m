After thinking about this more, I am wondering if the appearance of the 
ESS1888 not working then coming right at about the 1.0.13 alsa release 
is an artefact of when I shifted from mainly using the PWS600au to 
mainly using  the XP1000, and then trying out the es18xx driver at some 
stage, finding it works on the XP1000, but forgetting that it was on the 
PWS600au that it didn't work.  It's in the distant past now and memory 
is getting hazy...

Michael.
