Takashi replied with a suggestion to disable MMAP in the ice1724 driver. 
  I have been preoccupied with other things for the last couple of weeks 
so haven't had a chance to try it out.

I have applied the patch to the PWS600au.  Sound now works.  I can play 
8bit and 16bit sound files through the es1887 and the C-Media CM8738. 
They are both working fine.  I managed to get a 32bit sound file to play 
through the M-Audio Revolution too. (Though another 32bit sound file 
just produces silence through the M-Audio Rev. Haven't been able to 
establish why - the file looks fine to me.)  Repeated playing of files 
doesn't cause any problems.

I can't get sox's play to work (reports no mmap support, which is, of 
course, quite true).  I don't know how to tell sox to use the equivalent 
of alsa's hw device.  So I can't do the test on short files that Bob was 
  performing.

At this stage I've run out of time to test the M-Audio Rev in the XP1000 
and see if the MMAP disable patch help there.

Michael.
