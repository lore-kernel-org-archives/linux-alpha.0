It is similar to drivers/soc/bcm/brcmstb/pm/pm-arm.c.
See below for another idea.

Good question. Well, it if has to be called before kdump then
even "hypervisor" list is a wrong place because is not always
called before kdump.

IMHO, the timer informs the hardware that the system is still alive
in the middle of panic(). If the timer is not working then the
hardware (chip) will think that the system frozen in panic()
and will power off the system. See the comments in
drivers/power/reset/ltc2952-poweroff.c:

 * The following GPIOs are used:
 * - trigger (input)
 *     A level change indicates the shut-down trigger. If it's state reverts
 *     within the time-out defined by trigger_delay, the shut down is not
 *     executed. If no pin is assigned to this input, the driver will start the
 *     watchdog toggle immediately. The chip will only power off the system if
 *     it is requested to do so through the kill line.
 *
 * - watchdog (output)
 *     Once a shut down is triggered, the driver will toggle this signal,
 *     with an internal (wde_interval) to stall the hardware shut down.

IMHO, we really have to keep it alive until we reach the reboot stage.

Another question is how it actually works when the interrupts are
disabled during panic() and the timer callbacks are not handled.

I see. It is actually similar problem as with
drivers/firmware/google/gsmi.c.

I does similar things like kmsg_dump() so it should be called in
the same location (after info notifier list and before kdump).

A solution might be to put it at these notifiers at the very
end of the "info" list or make extra "dump" notifier list.
