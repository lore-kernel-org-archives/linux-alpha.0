Okay. The thing that "fixed" Tyson was disabling mmap from the driver:

http://mailman.alsa-project.org/pipermail/alsa-devel/2008-March/006911.html

It landed him in the same situation as you though, where that "asskickd.wav" 
mono, 8-bit 11025 file you sent me shows the same behaviour you reported. 
This might imply you weren't using mmap to begin with. You have no horribly 
obsolete alsa userland, nor an /etc/asound.conf or ~/.asoundrc?

No change with "aplay -M"? If there is a change, you'd expect it to be 
Tyson's old behaviour which means blowing up the machine on subsequent 
plays, so be a bit careful...

This one needs answer so as to possibly pin things down to format:
