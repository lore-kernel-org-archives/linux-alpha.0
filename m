Exactly the same as without the -w option.  (BTW, I would've never have 
guessed the -w option; my man file has -2 for conversion to 16 bit.)

The words "current event" are no longer repeated at the end of playing. 
  There is a click at the end of playing - hard to know whether it 
started to repeat something or whether it is truly at the end of the 
sound file.

Repeats the "al" bit of the last word "pal" at the end of playing.

I have another PWS600au - a little older than the one I was testing on. 
  It is slightly different in that its scsi controller is a separate 
board in a PCI slot, rather than on the motherboard.  Also has an 
ESS1888 rather than an ESS1887.  Just installed the same OS and kernel 
on it.

Tried playing sound.  What a mess. Crashes with mmap on.  Installed the 
patch turning off mmap.   Just produces buzzes and fart noises whatever 
sound file I try to play; both with aplay and sox.

Michael.
