That's nasty. Is alpha the only problematic arch here?

As to the patch in question, normally I'd just say we should make it
unconditionally u32. But we pack so nicely in the bio, and I don't think
the bio itself has this issue as the rest of the members that share this
word are all set before the bio is submitted. But callers embedding
the status var in other structures don't necessarily have that
guarantee, as your dm examples show.
