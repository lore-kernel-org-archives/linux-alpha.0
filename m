I have applied the patch against the 2.6.24.3 kernel, and now have  
working sound on the newer PWS600au with mmap enabled alsa.  Verified  
through the on board ESS1887 and via the M-Audio Revolution 7.1 sound  
card.  (Ran out of time to also try the C-Media sound card.  Also ran  
out of time to try it out on the other alphas I have.)

The problem with the repeated sound bits playing at the end of certain  
sound files via the ESS1887 remains.

Michael.
