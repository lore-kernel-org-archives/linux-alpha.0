Tight loop at the beginning of the file: rapid continuous repeat of approx.
the first couple tenths of a second.  Hitting <ctrl>C caused playback to
advance to the next small section of the soundfile.  Further <ctrl>C's did
nothing I noticed: had to type <ctrl>\ to kill sox.

Several seconds of silence, followed by what sounded like continuous pitched
machine-gun fire.  Each <ctrl>C advanced through the file (the pitch of the
machine-gun fire changed slightly).  Still had to type <ctrl>\ to kill sox.

Silence for longer than I had patience to wait :-).  Hitting <ctrl>C several
times finally got me to an even more rapid machine-gun fire than the previous
test.  As in the previous test, each <ctrl>C advanced further through the file,
although the perceived increment was smaller.  Still had to type <ctrl>\ to
kill sox.
