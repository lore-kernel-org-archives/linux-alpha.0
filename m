Ok, you shamed me into some tinkering too, and I fixed a couple of
issues with the alpha build.

The whole "pci_iounmap()" mess is not something I solved (you were
cc'd on the email I sent out about that), but I did test a few
different Jensen configurations and fixed a couple of uglies.

So at least _some_ Jensen configurations build cleanly once more, and
I re-enabled JENSEN as a valid machine target.

But if it doesn't boot, it's all fairly moot. And those things are a
pain to debug, and if the last booting kernel was years and years ago,
I don't think it realistically will necessarily ever be fixed.

Oh well. I have an odd love-hate relationship with alpha.

I think it's one of the worst architectures ever designed (memory
ordering is completely broken, and the lack of byte operations in the
original specs were a big reason for the initial problems and eventual
failure).

But at the same time, I really did enjoy it back in the day, and it
_was_ the first port I did, and the first truly integrated kernel
architecture (the original Linux m68k port that preceded it was a
"hack up and replace" job rather than "integrate")
