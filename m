Makes sense.

It is true that notifier lists might allow to add crazy stuff
without proper review more easily. Things added into the core
code would most likely get better review.

But nothing is error-proof. And bugs will happen with any approach.

I am not able to judge this. Of course, any extra step increases
the risk. I am just not sure how much more complicated it would
be to hardcode the calls. Most of them are architecture
and/or feature specific. And such code is often hard to
review and maintain.

4th or 5th? We already have "hypervisor", "info", "pre-reboot", and "pre-loop".
The 5th might be pre-crash-exec.

Honestly, I am not able to decide what might be better without seeing
the code.

Most things fits pretty well into the 4 proposed lists:
"hypervisor", "info", "pre-reboot", and "pre-loop". IMHO, the
only question is the code that needs to be always called
even before crash_dump.

I suggest that you solve the crash_dump callbacks the way that
looks best to you. Ideally do it in a separate patch so it can be
reviewed and reworked more easily.

I believe that a fresh code with an updated split and simplified
logic would help us to move forward.
