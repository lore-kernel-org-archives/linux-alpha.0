Okay.  I finally got everything tested on my Miata.  Unless I missed 
something, the es1888_init routine only gets compiled in with 
CONFIG_ALPHA_MIATA.  As I've been using the debian generic kernel (i.e., 
CONFIG_ALPHA_GENERIC), I have never relied on this routine for anything.

I did discover, however, when I compiled my own kernel (2.6.25-rc5) with 
CONFIG_ALPHA_MIATA, things stopped working.  Specifically, I no longer 
got any interupts (with or without the es1888_init patch and with or 
without the alternative es188xx interupt patch) associated with either 
the builtin sound card (es1888) or the IDE controller (CMD646).

With CONFIG_ALPHA_GENERIC I only get one interupt with the es18xx driver 
unless I applied to "alternative interupt" handling code.  Further, 
sometime between 2.6.14 and 2.6.16, mpg321 (using the alsa driver) 
started generating "Bad page state in process 'mpg321' ... Trying to fix 
it up, but a reboot is needed" kernel messages.

The machine would continue to operate okay though.  However, somewhere 
between 2.6.16 and 2.6.24, it also started crashing very shortly 
thereafter, giving the following backtrace: free_pages_check, 
free_hot_cold_pages, put_pages, free_page_and_swap_cache, unmap_cmas, 
unmap_region, default_wake_function, do_munmap, sys_munmap, entSys.

Hope this helps.

Cheers!  -Tyson
