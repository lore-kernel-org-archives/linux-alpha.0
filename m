I see. Hmm. It's a bit of a random thing to do it at the map time
though. E.g. DMA is all handled transparently behind the DMA API.
Hardening is much more than just replacing map with map_shared
and I suspect what you will end up with is basically
vendors replacing map with map shared to make things work
for their users and washing their hands.

I would say an explicit flag in the driver that says "hardened"
and refusing to init a non hardened one would be better.
