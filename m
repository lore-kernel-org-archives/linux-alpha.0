I'll try the below when I get back from my business trip (in approx.
two weeks).  Apologies for the inconvenience, but the Alpha hardly
qualifies as a laptop :-).  If someone else with a Miata (or other
Alpha with the ES1888 sound device) cares to give this a try, I *will*
be keeping up with my e-mail.
