Made no difference for any of the "sox" tests, and "play" is still
broken in the way it always has been.  However, "aplay" generated an
interesting error I haven't seen before:

$ aplay asskickd.wav
Playing WAVE 'asskickd.wav' : Unsigned 8 bit, Rate 11025 Hz, Mono
ALSA lib pcm_plug.c:773:(snd_pcm_plug_hw_refine_schange) Unable to find an usable access for 'default'
aplay: aplay.c:919: set_params: Assertion `err >= 0' failed.
Aborted by signal Aborted...

The ES18xx IRQ (5) is still not seeing any interrupt activity.

I *think* the only thing I haven't tried is Rene's patch that plays
around with the irqmask (es18xx_trial_and_error).  I'll give that a
shot and report back as soon as possible.
