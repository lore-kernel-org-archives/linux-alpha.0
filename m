Thanks again Michael, I'll stick with (a) for now. I'll check with ARM64
community about that, and I might even try to implement something in
parallel (if you are not already working on that - lemme know please),
so we don't get stuck here. As you said, I feel that this is more and
more relevant as the number of panic/crash/kexec scenarios tend to
increase in ARM64.

OK, perfect! I'll work something along these lines in V2, allowing the
FB notifier to always run in the hypervisor list before the vmbus unload
mechanism.

Since we're going to avoid relying in the custom crash_shutdown(), due
to the lack of ARM64 support for now, this check will be removed in V2.

Its purpose was to skip the notifier *proactively* in case kexec is set,
given that...once kexec happens, the custom crash_shutdown() would run
the same function (wrong assumption for ARM64, my bad).

Postponing that slightly would maybe gain us some time while the
hypervisor finish its work, so we'd delay less in the vmbus unload path
- that was the rationale behind this check.


Cheers!
