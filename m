Hmmm :-/  So obvious now that you mention it.

Right, got that.  On the PWS600au it shows the same problems that Bob 
describes!  When I play it with aplay (through the es1887) I get the 
last "pal" repeated at the end.  When I play it with sox (also through 
the es1887) I get the words "current event" repeated at the end.

Playing through the CM8738 also repeats the words "current event" at the 
end when playing with sox.  But using aplay through the CM8738 only 
results in silence and aplay hangs.  A ctrl-c successfully breaks it.

I suspect you are right - the symptoms I have observed (complete system 
crashes) are separate from what Bob observes.  One question I have is 
what is different about Bob's set up that enables the sound to work with 
mmap?

On the XP1000 (which has an unmodified kernel 2.6.24.3) I managed to 
play the sound file once with aplay through the es1887 (and it repeated 
"pal" at the end).  Then I tried using sox and complete silence 
resulted.   No,  it's just playing back at the wrong rate - everything 
is sounding slow and extremely flat - the silence is just the artefact 
of a little bit of silence at the start of the file being played at far 
too a slow sample rate.  Even other client programs are affected - mocp 
is playing back music at a horrendously slow sample rate. Yuk. 
Hopefully a rmmod es1887 might fix that - but I can't test it to I send 
this message and shut down X.

Anyway I really must start marking that pile of assignments I told the 
students that I would have done by tomorrow.  Further testing will have 
to wait to later this week.

Michael.
